            | In order for a more open and transparent system to be truly efficient, users must be able to be held accountable for their actions. With the introduction of cryptocurrencies and the Internet of Value, it is finally possible to  create transparent incentive-based systems online. We can now connect digital action with value in a very real and precise way.
